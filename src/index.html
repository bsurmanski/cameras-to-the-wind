      <h1>Why</h1>
      <p>The project is an exploration of distant connection and trust. We handed out these cameras to friends we trust, and we hope that everyone in the chain does so too. We probably don’t know you, and we might not even live in the same city or country. If you receive a camera, there isn’t really a reason to participate other than curiosity and shared responsibility.</p>

      <h1>Tips</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Share something that means something to you. There’s no wrong answers. Some examples include:
          <ul>
            <li>Favourite places</li>
            <li>Favourite Hobbies and Activities</li>
            <li>Objects with meaning</li>
            <li>Life routines</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use the flash. Film cameras have issues if there is not enough light but tolerate too much light. Especially if you’re inside or the sun is starting to go down, there isn’t as much light as you’d think. For camera details see <a href="http://photojottings.com/fujifilm-quicksnap-review/">this</a> blog post (unaffiliated).</li>
        <li>Prefer sunlit, outdoor scenes. Again, too little light is often a problem.</li>
        <li>Follow the “grandma” rule. Don’t take pictures of anything you wouldn’t show your grandma. Keep it PG please.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>I took a picture, what now?</h2>
      <p>Send us an email with the camera name (written on the tag). When (and if) we get the camera back we’ll post the pictures onto the site and email you back.</p>

      <h2>Will the pictures be shared publicly?</h2>
      <p>No. The pictures will only be shared with those who participated with a given camera. And only if we get the camera back at the end of the chain. Of course, other participants would have access to the pictures too, so we suggest you avoid sharing incriminating or personally identifying information.</p>

      <h2>If I contact you, will you share my email address?</h2>
      <p>No. This project is based on trust. It would be pretty rude if we violated that trust. At the same time, if you don’t trust us, we get it, feel free to use a disposable email address.</p>

      <h2>Is this project affiliated with a company or association?</h2>
      <p>No. We’re just a few friends that thought it would be cool.</p>

      <h2>Wow this is cool, can I donate to the cause?</h2>
      <p>The cost of the disposable cameras, film processing, and web hosting isn’t too expensive. But it is coming out of our pockets. We don’t really mind, we’re working on this with no expectation of financial compensation. Like the cameras, we’re putting this project out there in good faith.</p>
